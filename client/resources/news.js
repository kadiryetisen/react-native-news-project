      content:
        "Too much of a good thing can make anyone queasy as many will be aware after a week of turkey leftovers. The same applies to the economy and markets, if analysts predictions for the year ahead are anything to go by. Sitting around doing nothing or passive investment is an admirable strategy in most years. In 2021 it was masterly. Londons stock benchmark, the FTSE 100, ended December 14,3 higher than last January, and in the US buying shares has been even more rewarding the SP 500 went up more than a quarter in value. But even though money was apparently so easy to make last year, investors and economists are putting on a show of wariness for 2022. Advertisement Investors have enjoyed bumper returns over the past 18 months, but these returns are, in large part, borrowed from the future, says Joseph Little, chief global strategist at HSBC Asset Management. He thinks a pay-back period is in order. Guy Foster, his counterpart at wealth management firm Brewin Dolphin, says 2021’s gains increased at breakneck pace, and the best we can hope for is a gentle deceleration rather than a painful crunch. And Emiel van den Heiligenberg at Legal  General Investment Management even mentions the dreaded b-word – bubble – even if only to point out that we’re not quite there yet, despite some of the market madness of 2021. Forecasting stock index movements is always a bit of a mug’s game – as the pandemic has underlined – so some limited kudos must go to those who still place their bets publicly. The brave souls who have put their reputations on the line to make forecasts for the year ahead range from Morgan Stanley (S&P 500 down 9%) to Wells Fargo (S&P 500 up 11%)  a sign of the uncertainty among investors.Missouri state government.

      content:
        "The year ahead will be dominated by efforts to fight inflation along with climate change, while global economic growth will be reasonably strong and stock markets weak, according to an economic forecaster. The world starts the year with economies held back by a supply chain crisis and the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, but the global economy is still expected to grow by about 4% in 2022, compared with an estimated 5.1% in 2021, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), a UK thinktank. Happy new year? Five economic flashpoints to beware in 2022 Read more Douglas McWilliams, the founder and executive deputy chairman of the CEBR, said the group had been forecasting 6.7% growth for the UK in 2021 but reduced it to 6.6% after a weak December. “We estimate £3bn or so of lost GDP from people staying at home and not spending, plus the impact of the restrictions in Wales and Scotland.” Similarly, the 2021 forecast for global growth was cut by 0.1 percentage points to 5.1%. The new year will start slowly for the UK, but as supply issues get resolved and with unspent savings burning holes in people’s pockets, GDP is forecast to grow by at least 4% in 2022. The biggest issue facing policymakers around the world, especially in the US and the UK, is likely to be inflation, the thinktank said. The Bank of England unexpectedly lifted interest rates in December after a rise in inflation to a decade high of 5.1% and signalled that more rate rises will follow in 2022 as soaring energy costs are expected to push inflation to 6% in the spring. The US Federal Reserve has pencilled in three rate hikes next year and accelerated the rate at which it cuts spending on government bonds in the face of what one official called “alarmingly high inflation”. The CEBR said inflation could jump beyond 6% in the UK and to more than 7% in the US, where it reached a 39-year high of 6.8% in November. ",

      content:
        "I’m a literary agent and at the height of last year’s Black Lives Matter protests I was sent a list, with accompanying photographs, of the top editors working across the major publishing houses in the UK. When I read it I burst into tears. It showed a sea of almost totally white faces, some of whom had been approaching retirement when I started out as an editorial assistant 20 years earlier. The stagnation in the industry was stark and filled me with despair.Analysis of the industry since then, partly led by pressure from BLM and an open letter from the Black Writers Guild, has only further highlighted this imbalance. Two of the biggest global publishers, Penguin Random House and Hachette, revealed that just 2.7% of their staff – in both cases – are black; and the Guardian reported that you are eight times more likely to see an animal as lead character in a children’s book than a person of colour.Advertisement In a modern, multicultural nation, the whiteness of the industry matters. This summer, the bestselling author Kate Clanchy chose to rewrite her memoir after an outcry over her portrayal of minority-ethnic children. Her book, Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me, used racialised terminology such as “chocolate-coloured skin”, it referred to one student as African Jonathon, a Somali child as having a narrow skull and described another as being so small and square and Afghan with his big nose and premature moustache",

It will explore a time period known as the Epoch of Reionization, which came after the dark ages following the Big Bang. The longer wavelengths enable Webb to look much closer to the beginning of time and to hunt for the unobserved formation of the first galaxies, as well as to look inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today, the agency said. Astronomers worldwide will use the Webb, and its science objectives require the Webb infrared observatory to be very large – so large that it can't fit into the nose cone of any available launch vehicle in its operational configuration.

        "Legendary NFL player and coach Dan Reeves passed away early this morning, peacefully and surrounded by his loving family at his home in Atlanta, GA. He passed away at age 77 due to complications from a long illness. His legacy will continue through his many friends, players and fans as well as the rest of the NFL community. Arrangements are still to be determined, the statement read. The Georgia native had been in the NFL in some capacity from 1965 to 2003. The Dallas Cowboys signed Reeves before the 1965 season.

        "Its quite the turnaround for the Arkansas program in just its second year under head coach Sam Pittman. After finishing 2-10 just two seasons ago, Arkansas has its first nine-win season since 2011 under Bobby Petrino. Working without star receiver Treylon Burks, the Arkansas passing offense was almost non-existent. Burks, a potential first-round pick, opted out. His 1,135 receiving yards were No. 1 on the team, far more than any other Razorbacks pass catcher. Next up was Warren Thompson, who came into the game with 18 receptions for 292 yards. Thompson was credited with an interception on the day, resulting in a failed trick play just before half. While the first interception of the game was thrown by K.J. Jefferson, Thompson didn’t do his quarterback any favors. On Arkansas’ first drive of the game, it was Thompson who was standing wide open in the end zone. As Jefferson threw towards him, Thompson was outworked by safety Ja’Ayir Brown, who came down with the touchdown saving pick. Thompson finished with just one catch for 12 yards on two targets. Jefferson, meanwhile, threw for just 90 yards on 14-of-19 passing and was sacked five times. The Arkansas rushing offense, entering the day No. 11 in the FBS, had its way with the Penn State front. Dominique Johnson led the backfield with 85 yards on 11 carries. Raheim Sanders had 13 carries for 79 yards and two touchdowns. ",

        "One day after quietly celebrating his 37th birthday at home with his family, LeBron James put on an age-defying performance. James became the oldest player in NBA history to have a game with at least 40 points and 14 rebounds, scoring a season-high 43 on Friday night as the Los Angeles Lakers rolled to a 139-106 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. According to Sportradar, the oldest player to have a 40-14 game was Larry Bird, who was 35 when he had 49 points and 14 boards for the Boston Celtics in 1992 (which coincidentally also came against the Trail Blazers). I dont feel like I have been in the league 19 years. When I am daily reminded of it, I feel it sometimes, James said after his 67th 40-point game of his career and sixth in four seasons with the Lakers. Sometimes you do have to remind people you can still do what you can do at a high level.One day after quietly celebrating his 37th birthday at home with his family, LeBron James put on an age-defying performance.
